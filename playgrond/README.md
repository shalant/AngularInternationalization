# I18n
I learned this at Skillstorm. It is an offical way to translate. In my first stab, I was able to create an extra file where I translated everything on the basic app.component.html to Serbian, but couldn't figure out how to run it in English...so perhaps run it from an ngIF statement based on the user's browser location? This came from the Youtuber "Coding with Sloba"
